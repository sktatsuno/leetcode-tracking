**3/17/25** 
- Only a max of 2 elements could appear more than 1/3 of the time
- In majority element I incremented or decremented a number to represent votes towards one number or the other
- can't necessarily do that with 1/3 right
- Using 2 different counter and 2 different candidates
- I got close to getting the first pass correct. But needed help to do second pass
