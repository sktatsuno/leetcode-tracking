- 3/14/25: Amy initially did problem. 
- You don't want to focus on removing the val, you want to focus on moving the non-target values - Ana
- 3/16/25: Solved problem with 2 pointer but probably not in best way. Solved too slow for an easy. Clearly need to practice two pointer fundamentals.
- 3/16/25: Redid problem with 1 pass solution focusing on moving the non-target values instead of swapping. Way simpler and solution feels much better. Makes more sense logically.
